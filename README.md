Context Aware Routing in Internet of Things

In this project we will use single-path routing to send information from source (user node) to destination (user node) by traversing a number of relaying nodes. What we are trying to show here, in detail, is the benefits of a central -- context aware -- server. By varying the parameters of described stochastic processes we will evaluate the best technique in finding the shortest path. 

The motivation for the project comes from the growing use of smart phones and internet compatible devices. In wireless cellular communication the majority of the cost comes from bandwidth usages. For this reason we wish to minimize the total number of time information needs to be transferred through networks. To reflect this in our project the goal will be to find the shortest path for information to travel from user to user. Note that shortest path, in this context, implies the using the smallest number of relay nodes to get from user to user. The process of finding the shortest path holds the content of the context aware routing, that is the central service will determine the paths. The central server will hold key information about each user. For specifics see next section or the project proposal. 

In this project we will consider a general framework for context awareness in delay tolerant networks. In this project the context awareness feature will consist of central server capable of decision making on a set multiple options. The goal of the implemented simulation will be to find the shortest path for information to travel from source (user node) to destination (user node). The paths will be determined by the context aware server hand in hand with the corresponding decision making criteria.
